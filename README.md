# CUL

This is an offical implementation of "Contrastive Uncertainty Learning for Iris Recognition with Insufficient Labeled Samples" (Accepted by IJCB, oral).
To best of my knowledge, CUL is the first work for unsupervised iris recognition, and it achieves data augmentation based on the probabilistic embedding (uncertainty embedding) and applies contrastive self-supervised learning.
